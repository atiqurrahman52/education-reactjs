            guided project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through 
            the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to 
            that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by
             Coursera, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Coursera will have no
              refund obligations. Coursera disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party
             marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.`,
